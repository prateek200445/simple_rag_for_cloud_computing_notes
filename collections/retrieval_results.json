      "\"Computation may someday be organized as a public utility.\" \n This visionary idea planted the seed for what would eventually become cloud computing \n— where computing resources could be accessed like electricity or water. \n1990s – Foundations and Early Technologies \n Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) emerged, allowing secure access to remote networks \nand hinting at decentralized computing. \n Grid Computing gained popularity — a form of distributed computing where resources \nfrom multiple locations worked together to solve large-scale tasks. \n These technologies laid the groundwork for cloud-based infrastructure by promoting \nresource sharing and remote accessibility. \n2006 – Commercial Cloud Era Begins \n Amazon Web Services (AWS) launched EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) and S3 (Simple \nStorage Service)."

Q1 What is Cloud computing?

answer 1 Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the Internet—these
services include:
 Servers

1. What is the Cloud Reference Model?

Answer:
The Cloud Reference Model is a conceptual framework that describes how cloud computing services are structured and delivered. It divides services into three main layers: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), each offering a different level of abstraction and control between users and providers.

2. What are the key features of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)?

Answer:
Key features of IaaS include:

Virtualization of servers, storage, and networks

On-demand resource provisioning

Elastic scalability

Pay-as-you-go pricing

Examples include Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.

3. Who typically uses PaaS and what are its benefits?

Answer:
PaaS is mainly used by software developers, application engineers, and DevOps teams.
Benefits:

Simplifies application development and deployment

Abstracts infrastructure management

Provides built-in scalability and load balancing

Offers integrated tools like IDEs and middleware support

4. What distinguishes SaaS from other cloud service models?

Answer:
SaaS (Software as a Service) delivers fully functional applications over the internet. Users only manage their data and usage, while the provider handles updates, security, and infrastructure.
Examples include Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and Salesforce.

5. What are the four main types of cloud deployment models?

Answer:
The four deployment models are:

Public Cloud – shared over the internet, owned by third-party providers.

Private Cloud – dedicated to one organization, offering high security.

Community Cloud – shared by organizations with common goals.

Hybrid Cloud – integrates public and private clouds for flexibility.

6. What are the benefits and use cases of the Public Cloud?

Answer:
Benefits: Cost-effective, scalable, globally available, and easy to set up.
Use Cases: Startups launching apps, e-commerce sites with variable traffic, and test environments.
Examples: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform.

7. How does a Private Cloud differ from a Public Cloud?

Answer:
A Private Cloud is used exclusively by one organization, offering more control, security, and customization, while a Public Cloud is shared by multiple organizations and managed by third-party providers.
Private clouds are ideal for financial institutions, government agencies, and healthcare providers.

8. What is a Hybrid Cloud and what are its advantages?

Answer:
A Hybrid Cloud combines public and private cloud infrastructures, enabling data and applications to move between them.
Advantages:

Flexibility in workload placement

Cost optimization

Improved disaster recovery

Seamless integration of systems

9. What responsibilities does a user have in each cloud service model (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS)?

Answer:

SaaS: Users manage only data and application usage.

PaaS: Users manage application code and configuration.

IaaS: Users manage OS, applications, and configurations.

10. Which cloud service model provides the highest level of control and why?

Answer:
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides the highest level of control because users can manage operating systems, applications, and network configurations, while the provider handles the physical infrastructure and virtualization.

7. What is VMware ESXi and where is it used?

Answer:
VMware ESXi is a Type 1 bare-metal hypervisor by VMware. It provides enterprise-level performance, live migration (vMotion), snapshots, and centralized management using vCenter Server.
Use Case: Enterprise data centers and mission-critical cloud environments.

8. Describe KVM and its key features.

Answer:
KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is an open-source Type 1 hypervisor built into the Linux kernel.
Key Features:

Uses Intel VT-x/AMD-V for hardware acceleration

Integrated with Linux for low overhead

Supports live migration and multiple management tools (libvirt, virt-manager)
Use Case: Public/private clouds (e.g., OpenStack).

9. What is the Xen hypervisor and how does it operate?

Answer:
Xen is an open-source Type 1 hypervisor using a microkernel design.

Uses Dom0 (privileged domain) to manage hardware and guest VMs (DomU).

Supports Paravirtualization (PV), Hardware Virtualization (HVM), and PVH (Hybrid).
Used In: AWS EC2, Citrix Hypervisor, and secure cloud environments.

2. What are the types of hypervisors and how do they differ?

Answer:

Type 1 (Bare-Metal) Hypervisor: Runs directly on the physical hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen, KVM). It offers better performance and is used in enterprise environments.

Type 2 (Hosted) Hypervisor: Runs on top of an existing OS (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation). It is easier to set up and used mainly for testing or development.

3. What are the key types of virtualization?

Answer:

Hardware Virtualization – Runs multiple OSs on one hardware system.

Storage Virtualization – Combines multiple storage devices into one virtual pool.

Network Virtualization – Merges hardware and software network resources.

Desktop Virtualization – Hosts desktops centrally for remote access.

Application Virtualization – Runs applications on a server as if local.

4. What are the main benefits of virtualization?

Answer:

Resource Optimization: Better hardware utilization.

Isolation: VMs operate independently, reducing failure risks.

Scalability: Easily clone or migrate VMs.

Flexibility & Portability: Move VMs across servers or locations.

Cost Savings: Reduces hardware and power costs.

1. What is virtualization?

Answer:
Virtualization is a technology that allows a single physical computer to run multiple virtual environments or systems, known as virtual machines (VMs). Each VM behaves like an independent physical system but shares the resources of the host computer through a software layer called the hypervisor.


Here are **10 question-and-answer pairs** based fully on your uploaded **UNIT-4_Notes.pdf (Securing the Cloud)** — all content is **100% from your PDF**, with no external information added:

---

### **1. What is Cloud Information Security and why is it important?**

**Answer:**
Cloud Information Security refers to the strategies, technologies, and policies used to protect data, applications, and infrastructure in cloud environments. It ensures **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)** of resources against threats like breaches or data loss. It’s essential because organizations store sensitive data on shared, internet-accessible platforms.

---

### **2. Explain the components of the CIA Triad in cloud security.**

**Answer:**

* **Confidentiality:** Restricts access to authorized users only (e.g., encryption, MFA, RBAC).
* **Integrity:** Ensures data is accurate and unaltered using hashing, checksums, and audit logs.
* **Availability:** Keeps systems accessible through redundancy, backups, and disaster recovery.

---

### **3. What is the Shared Responsibility Model in cloud computing?**

**Answer:**
The **Shared Responsibility Model** defines how security duties are divided between the **cloud provider** and the **customer**.

* **Provider:** Secures physical infrastructure, networking, and hypervisor.
* **Customer:** Manages data protection, access controls, application security, and configuration.
  Example: Leaving a storage bucket public is the customer’s fault, not the provider’s.

---

### **4. List and describe the main threat vectors in cloud environments.**

**Answer:**

1. **Data Breaches** – Unauthorized data access due to weak controls.
2. **Account Hijacking** – Stolen credentials from phishing or reuse.
3. **Insecure APIs** – Poorly secured interfaces exploited for attacks.
4. **Denial of Service (DoS)** – Overwhelming traffic causing downtime.
